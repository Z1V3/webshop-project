# Next.js Webshop with .NET API Backend

This repository contains the source code for a modern webshop application built using Next.js (App Router) for the frontend (with Tailwind CSS) and a .NET API for the backend. It's designed to improve my skills in full-stack web development, demonstrating proficiency in both frontend and backend technologies.

    * JavaScript: For static typing and improved code maintainability.
* **Backend:**
    * .NET API: For handling data requests, business logic, database interactions and authentication/authorization.
    * Entity Framework Core
    * Started as Database-First (now switched to Model-First) 
* **Database:**
    * SQL Server
* **Other:**
    * Swiper
